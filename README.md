# Mario Themed Doorbell #

## Introduction ##

Who wants a boring old doorbell that simply goes "ding dong" when pressed?
I sure didn't! That's why I decided to design my own doorbell that provides
ample entertainment for the guest at the door. Now, introducing the new
Mario Doorbell; it's flashy, it's got coins, and it's guaranteed to increase the
frequency of ding-dong ditchers or your money back! In fact, your guests won't
even be at your door to visit you, they'll be too busy racking up coins to even
notice you.
